# Rock-Paper-Scissors

An app that allows users to play the game "rock, paper, scissors" against the computer. 

## Overview

On the landing page, a user will be shown the rules for both the classic version and difficult version of the "game rock, paper, scissors". The difficult version includes two additional choices. Once the user selects the version they would like to play, they will be brought to a new page showing all of the choices for that version of the game. The user can make their selection by clicking on an icon. The app will then make a random choice for the computer and a new page will appear showing the winner. The scores on the sides of the screen will be updated accordingly and the game will automatically re-start. While playing, the user can click the "change game" button at the bottom of the screen to go back to the home page and select a different game (the score will still remain the same). The user can also click the "reset score" button on the bottom of the screen while playing to reset both scores to zero.
